         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> With my fellow tennantes that haue liued vnder <hi>Iob</hi> theſe many yeares, (for he is a man that wil not eaſily be brought to remoue an olde tennant) muſt needes very<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the teſtimony of theſe men concerning him: for ſurely hee is a man very pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and bene ficial to ſuch as want, and ready to ſuccour ſuch as haue any way ſuſtained wrong to the vttermoſt of his power. And as for my ſelfe and my eſtate vnder him, it is ſuch as I would not deſire a better Lord.</p>
                  <p>I know none like him in all this Country. I heare them complaine euery where of the hardnes of their Landlords, as that they are ſtill commaunding ſuch ſeruice at their handes, as they can neuer be quiet, nor haue any time to followe their owne buſineſſe. Their purſe, prouiſion for their owne Houſe, Corne, Graſſe, Cattle, Cart, Plow, Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14506:10"/>Aſſes, Cammels, muſt be at their commaund, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they will call them, what occaſion ſoeuer they haue of their own, or what vſe ſoeuer of their commodities. Their faſhion is like wiſe, vpon euery light cauſe to put out their tennant, or if they can finde no coulourable matter againſt him, to finde a hole in his coppy or leaſe, and ſo to make him forfeit his eſtate. And now that the world beginneth to abound with people, to raiſe their rents, or to put them to great fines, ten times the valew they were wont to pay, &amp; yet notwithſtanding to abridege the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very much of their old eſtate. For if there be a good incloſure, meddow, peece of ground, woods for building, or fuel, that, they take in their own hands. Let the tennant ſpeak to them of this, he ſhall be reuiled; let him plead his right, ſo far is he from hauing his cauſe heard, that they threaten him either with death or baniſhment, or beggery, if he proceed, or elſe they rate him thus: What wilt thou quarrell wich thy Lord? Thou wrangler thou, thou impudent fellow? How dareſt thou be ſo bold to meddle with mee thy Lord and Maiſter, from whom thou, thy Wife, children, and ſeruants, haue your maintenance, and by whom thou haſt reaped this and that benifit? Or elſe they lay ſuch matter of accuſation againſt him, that may indanger his life, and ſo the forfeiture of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and goods into their hands. Of ſuch Landlordes the word is full, and poore tennants feele it to their ſmart.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Iob</hi> he is none of this ranke, for if there be any thing grieueth his tennant, he is very ready to heare his allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note n="a" place="margin">chap, 31, 13</note> and to yeald rather to the loſſe of ſome of his own right, then that hee ſhould ſuſtaine the leaſt wrong. Yea when a tennant complaineth vnto him, hee is not at reſt, vntill he hath ſatiſfied him to bis content, and he is glad to ſee that he is willing to thriue vnder him. And when hee perceiueth him to be behind hand, he laboureth to helpe him, bid deth him call for his letters, or his word to any friend that may pleaſure him.</p>
                  <p>In the time of Warre he defendeth him with his armies,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14506:10"/>and when the King calleth for his ſeruice or tribute, he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him all he may; for he knoweth that the Lord hath appointed him but as his Steward ouer his people, and that he muſt render an account vnto him one day, how be hath demeaned himſelfe in his office.</p>

                  <p>When a ſeruant hath cauſe to debate with him about a matter of difference,<note n="a" place="margin">Chap, 31, 13</note> he diſdaineth not to confer with him about it, but with all meekeneſſe ſubmitteth himſelfe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring<note n="b" place="margin">chap, 31, 15</note> that he is made of the ſame mould, begotten of the ſame ſeede, formed after the ſame manner in the Womb, purchaſed with the ſame bloud, appointed to the ſame inheritance with him.

                  <p>THe grauity of this mans perſon, and his ſeuere counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (well befitting a gouernor of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth) hath made me withdraw my ſelfe oftentims when hee paſſed through the ſtreete, as being terrified with the ſight of his countenance,<note n="a" place="margin">chap, 29, 8</note> and not daring to looke him in the face. He doth more good with his very ſight and looks, then others can doe with their cruell threates, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for it is a great matter to be of ſober and graue car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe, pithy, and ſententious of ſpeach, of a conſtant iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

For Rhetoricke allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth onely the care, grauity lodgeth in the hart: popularity is not in nature, but commeth of affectation; and therefore is liked but for a time, and can neuer be fitted to all mens fancyes.

And though his humility and curteſie be ſuch, that he wold not ſuffer mee to be vncouered, or to ſtand, but biddeth me, (if he be not in his ſeat of Iuſtice) couer my head, and ſit downe when I come before him; yet notwithſtanding his place and worthines requiring it, I thinke I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the honour due to ſo rare a perſonage, if I ſhould do the one or the other in his preſence. For if honor be to be giuen to auncient yeares (which muſt needes be confeſſed to be a duty in nature,) then much more to wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and vertue, which are more ancient then the world it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The ſpeciall thing mouing the younger ſort to an eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14506:12"/>of their elders, is a ſuppoſall of more experience, piety, and knowledge then to themſelues: which if they find not, they withdraw their reuerence, and preferre in their iudgement ſuch (how yong ſoeuer) whom they finde moſt beautified with theſe good Ornamentes. The elders likewiſe, and gray-headed fathers themſelues, that are of greateſt place, are woont to admire and honor the Perſons of young men, to whom they find themſelues inferiour in counſell and vnderſtanding. This moueth me, and the reſt of the auncient, ſo highly and honourably to repute and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of Iob, for in him are moſt eminent, knowledge, prudence, grauity, courage, conſtancy, godlineſſe, and whatſoeuer beſide may garniſh a gouernor and ruler of the common-wealth.</p>

                  <p>IN regard of this great wiſedome and iudgement of his, they that are ioyned in counſell with him, are al ſilent Chap, 29, 9, 10, when he commeth in place. We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre of matters, but we decree nor conclude vpon nothing till we heare him ſpeake. And therefore we expect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect altogether in our meeting his ſentence: which as it is expected and deſired of vs, Chapter, 29, 11, ſo when it commeth, reſolueth ſo fully that was in queſtion, that wee forthwith as muing nothing to except againſt it, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to condiſcend thereunto.</p>
                  <p>It was neuer knowne as yet, that any thing agreed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and decreed by his apptobation, hath beene reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, diſliked, or repined at afterward; but that whatſoeuer ordinance hath beene enacted at his conſent and deſire, hath had the allowance and commendation of al men, and hath procured him a bleſsing Chapter, 29, 11. at the hands of both rich and poore, together with the well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of all ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that the people haue a conceit that all good
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14506:12"/>that is done for the common-wealth is by means of Iob, and nothing done without him. This it is to haue the good opinion and harts of the Commons.</p>

                  <p>VErily he hath our good opinion and loue of our harts, the prayers and bleſsings of vs all, ch. 29, 11, which alſo he wel deſerueth: neither haue we a conceit of him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his worth, but his worchines is farre more then wee conceiue. Whatſoeuer good hath come vnto the land, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath beene the immediate cauſe thereof, or elſe it hath proceeded from his good example. (For the good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a man in authority, is a ſpeciall meanes to drawe on others to the imitation of his vertues.)</p>
                  <p>I would wee had many ſuch gouernours, that our loue might not be thus abridged to one, but imparted to more! O it were aſweete thing, to ſee Princes contending who ſhould excell other in the gouernment of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: yet ſo, that they would not forget the emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ought to be in men of eminent place concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vertuous life. For no muſicke ſoundeth more pleaſant in the eares of the Commons, then to heare, that wiſedome and vertue go ioyntly togither in the Nobility of the Land.</p>
                  <p>But it is very Lamentable to conſider, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining there is euery where of Noble-men: If they woulde ſtuddye to bee like Iob, then there would bee no ſuch matter againſt them. Hee chap. 31, 1, hath made a couenaunt with his eyes, that they ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure him to Wantonneſſe, and that he wil not abuſe them vanity.</p>
                  <p>I woulde the reſt of the Nobility woulde make ſuch a Couenaunt, and keepe it as hee doeth. For a chaſt bodye, chaſt lookes, chaſt thoughtes, where are
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14506:13"/>ſo many incitements and prouocations to euill: deſerueth no vulgar commendation, and the want of theſe is no ſmal blemiſh and blot to their houſes, it ſtaineth alſo their blood, whereby all manner of vice ouerſpreadeth their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. For though vertue doth not, yet vice doth come by propagation. What cuill then may wee not expect in the Noble, and what puniſhment are not they themſelues to looke for, as diſeaſes of body, conſumption of goods, ſale of inheritance, rooting out of ſtocke, anguiſh of ſoule, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, &amp; the fire of Gods wrath to deuour that their fire where the ſinne of vncleannes raigneth. <hi>Iobes</hi> foot goeth not awry.

But when ſhall a man finde almoſt other Noblemen in the waye, they are out of the way in the adminiſtration of Iuſtice, out of the way in the gouernement of themſelues and their families, out of the way in their recreations, as being either not lawdable, or immoderate.</p>

                  <p>And as for the increaſe of his ſubſtance, though it bee growen to be exceeding great, yet ſurely hee is not proud of it, neither doth he boaſt of it, as if it came by his owne wit, or induſtry, or as if he had receiued it for ſome deſert in him, more then in other men: neither doth he ſo reioyce in it, as if the delight of his hart were thereupon. But he is as humble with all his wealth, as he that hath not a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of bread for his belly: Bleſſing, and prayſing of God for his great benefits, is euer in his mouth, his hart is lifted vppe in prayer to GOD day and night, for grace to vſe them to his glory, the good of his Seruantes, and needy people.</p>

                  <p>O My children, the comfort of my life, I muſt remember you ſtil with my wonted inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Labor for the knowledge of the Lord, feare him, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his will, truſt in him alwaies, be diligent, and skilful in your calling<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Call your family to the hearing of the word,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14506:15"/>&amp; praier, and examine them in their faith, ſuffer no vnruely perſon to ſtay in your houſes, and for your owne partes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide the company of the vngodly, and giue them no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.</p>
                  <p>Keepe good hoſpitality, if it ſtand with your hability, for the Religious, Vertuous, Poore and Diſtreſſed. Doe good vnto all ſuch euery way, but let your comfort there be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, where you find moſt goodnes. Helpe the widdow and the fatherles; ſuccor the ſtranger, right the cauſe of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. In all theſe things, ſo farre as I follow the wil of the Lord, let my example be a pattern vnto you. But principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looke that the morning and euening ſacrifice be held vp in your houſes, knowing that without it, it is as impoſsible that the loue of God ſhould continue with you, as a lampe without oile, fire without fuel, the life without noriſhment. Eſpecially then look to this duty, when you are either fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting<note n="f" place="margin">Chap, 1, 4, 5</note> in your houſes, or abroad with your friends: for at ſuch times the fleſh being pampered, ouerwhelmeth the good graces of God, and cauſeth a ſecurity in vs. The thing I ſimply diſlike not, but greatly commend, as being a means to increaſe loue, to confer of Religion, and to ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in praier. And verily it reioyceth me at the hart, to ſee this concord and agreement among you my children, for therein I ſee (to my vnſpeakable comfort) the fruits of the labors I haue beſtowed vpon you, in your inſtructions; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo your louing and kind nature, vertuous and godly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. But my counſel is, that you be not too much in it, &amp; that when you do it, you take heed of exceſſe. For at Feaſts there is euer ſuperfluity of meate and wine, which making the hart merry, the tongue is apt to run ouer, and to breake forth into either wanton, vaine, reuengefull, reproachfull, or malicious words.</p>
                  <p>At ſuch times therefore be ſparing in your ſpeeches, and for the auoiding of ydle, and looſe talke, propound ſome godly queſtion to be debated, make a couenant with your eies, your eares, your appetite, ſpecially that they offend not, and with your heart, that it be not drawne away, nor
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14506:16"/>your minds ſo taken vp with thoſe pleaſant dainties, that you forget God. Beware likewiſe of diſorder, an vnſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble companion of banquets, and that you haue a reſpect to the time; for then to giue your ſelues to feaſting, when the Lord calleth for weeping and mourning, for the trangreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the land; or in time of war, famine, peſtilence, or any other calamity, (either publicke, or priuat, and concerning your ſelues) were ſuch an iniquity, as the Lord woulde not ſuffer to eſcape vnpuniſhed.</p>

Keep we then (deare brethren) this precept, and we ſhal not need to ſtand in feare of any diſquietnes, that may come vnto our reuerend father, or hurt to our ſelues by our feaſting. For why ſhould it be more hurtfull to vs, then to the godly of former ages, that haue al vſed it without exception?

O how tender, how dainty, and delicate they are? But when I take them once in hand, I put them to ſuch hard meate, and ſo cruſh them, that I bring them to diſpaire, and loe, then they are where I would haue them.

Thou enuieſt his proſperity, and that is the cauſe thou art ſo earneſt againſt him. This<note n="a" place="margin">Verſe. 1</note> thou thinkeſt wil make any man good, but it is cleane contrary: for albeit I haue appointed it as a meanes to make men better, yet through the corruption of nature, it hath turned to the marring of many of the better ſort of men.</p>
                  <p>It marred the old world, it marred the <hi>Sodomites:</hi> neither did <hi>Eſau</hi> (the founder and father of the Country where <hi>Iob</hi> dwelleth) want welth. Many haue I bleſſed heretofore as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantlie as now I doe Iob, and manie there are at this time in the world, among the <hi>Egiptians, Canaanites, Chaldeans Sabaans,</hi> and there are ſome in <hi>Edom</hi> to, that are not much inferior, yet notwithſtanding none of them al, haue beene induced thereby to ſerue me, but rather haue thereby taken an occaſion, to caſt off my yoke from their ſhoulders, and to yeeld themſelues ouer to al laſciuiouſneſſe and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of life.</p>
                  <p>Though I beſtow riches and rewards vpon men, to make them more in loue with me, yet for the moſt part they of all other are moſt vnkind, vnthankful, forgetful, proud, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, contemners of my worde, cruell, craftie, and requite me with worſe and harder meaſure then anie beſide. It is wonderful to ſee what contrarie effects riches work to thoſe that I intend? For whereas I beſtovv them as comfortes and helpes to the godlie in their proceeding and growing in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14506:21"/>Religion: they turne to the choking vp the good feedes of my word, to the drowning of the good graces of my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and conuerting them whom I haue not onely indued with a reaſonable ſoule, but inſpired with diuine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge into vnreaſonable beaſtes.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>Iob</hi> is an admirable man, whom wealth hath not corrupted, but made more dutifull, forward, and cheerefull in my ſeruice, and more humble toward the poore. And as for the feare of thy puniſhmentes, it is a very idle ſpeech, and a fond thing, for any one to ſtand in awe of ought thou canſt do againſt them, ſeeing thou canſt not lift vp thy finger againſt any one (no not the<note n="a" place="margin">Not Achab himſelfe. 1 Kings 22, 20, 22</note> moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked) without my ſpeciall leaue and authority. For albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it thy power is aboue theirs, they are by nature vnder thy thraldome, and thou leadeſt them for the moſt part as cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues and Priſoners at thy pleaſure: yet my hand is aboue thine, I redeeme whom I will, how vile ſinners ſoeuer, yea though veſſels of wrath, from vnder thy ſeruice, vſe toward them long patience, and ſhew toward them my rich fauours, and mercies for a time. Neither canſt thou hold any in perpetuall bondage, vntill I giue them wholy ouer vnto thy tyrranny.</p>
                  <p>In that thou vaunteſt of thy thouſands, whom thou haſt brought to thy ſeruice, or rather ſlauiſhe ſeruitude, for feare of puniſhment; thou ſayeſt truely, becauſe it is for feare, and not for loue they doe it. But what a miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous mind is this, that nothing will content thee, but the loſſe of al that euer he hath? Which how can it be granted thee? For by thine owne confeſſion, I haue ſet a Hedge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him for a defence againſt thee? Wilt thou haue mee to remoue that Hedge without a cauſe? But he feareth me not (thou ſayeſt) as I ſuppoſe: but whatſoeuer he doth is in Hypocriſie, that ſo his turne may be ſerued: wherein to omit thy impudency in controling my teſtimony of him, (and that to my face) thou ſhalt find by wofull experience, that hee is no Hypocrite, neither can bee brought by the greateſt affliction thou canſt deuiſe, to curſe, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme me.</p>

O the vncertainety of the thinges of this life! O how vading and fleeting they are, (euen a verie ſpunge) now full, nowe drie.</p>
                  <p>This verie morning, I was owner of ſeuen thouſand Sheepe, three thouſand Cammels, fiue hundered yoake of Oxen, fiue hundred ſhee-Aſſes. This morning I was Maiſter of a great Familie, and I had many hundreds of Man-ſeruants, and Maide-ſeruantes, bondmen, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Farmers, and Tennants, with their Wiues, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14506:24"/>depending vpon me: ſome for Tillage, and other for Husbandry: ſome for the heardes of Cattle, ſome for the Cammels and Aſſes, ſome for Trauaile and Marchandize to other Countries; which is a cheefe vſe of thoſe Beaſtes, Finally, (which is the onely thinge that indeede maketh me thus to dwell vppon this recitall, as being neuer ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with it, and ready to take euery occaſion againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to enter into it.</p>
                  <p>This morning I was a father of tenne children, but now I am not owner ſo much as of one Cammell, one Oxe, one Aſſe, one Sheepe? Now I am not Maiſter of fiue ſeruants, no, not of one; for they are become my Maiſters, and mocke at my calamity; Now I am no father at al; now I am vtterly childles, my fountaine is dryed vp, my fruite is turned into barrennes.</p>
                  <p>By the courſe of nature my children ſhould haue ſurui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me; neither was there any appearance to the contrary, they were all in the prime and flower of their time, they were al luſtie and ſtrong, they liued in health, wealth, and pleaſure, yet the hand of the Lord hath taken them away, and I their father remaine behinde them, to doe that dutye for them which I looked that they ſhoulde haue done for mee.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt remember my ſelfe. For thus farre I haue yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to nature: and now it is time that I cal my ſelfe backe to the conſideration of the ſmiter whoſe hand hath done this, whoe as he gaue meal, ſo hee might in right take all: For his they were and not mine, I was but a Tennant at wil in them, he might recouer them into his proper poſſeſsion whenſoeuer he would. I brought nothing into the world at the firſt but nakednes, had it not pleaſed him to cloath me, I had remained ſo ſtill: which if hee had done, where had my coſtlie attire, my thouſands of increaſe and goodly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie beene? But had I died poſseſsed of all my goodes, coulde I haue carried to my graue (whether now the Lord is about to bringe mee) anie thing more then a winding ſheete?</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:14506:24"/>
                  <p>God ſaw it good that it ſhould bee thus, hee knoweth that men in proſperity eaſily forget both him, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; are vnmindfull from whence they come, and dream of an immortality here vpon earth.</p>
                  <p>Men when they grow rich, they grow laſie, and are like vnto reſtie lades, and therefore need the ſpurre of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to quicken them. Abundance is a lethargy, that benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth mens ſences in ſuch ſort, that they haue no liuely fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their wretched eſtate: For theſe, the Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the whip of correction to rouze them from theyr ſecurity. As long as wee are aloft here in this world, our minds are taken vp with the things below, and not lifted vp to him that is aboue. Wealth abounding, the worſhip of God is at a low ebbe, heauen is buried with vs in the graue while we are in our glorie; our eies being filled with the thinges of this life, our heartes are empty of humility to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God or man, and of the conſideration of other mens wants.</p>
                  <p>The beſt of vs al are that point: it is good therefore that we ſhould be abaſed. While we haue the ſpectacle of death before our eies, we ſee into our end: otherwiſe wee caſt it behind our backes. In this regard, that heauy and woful ſight of my childrens Funerals (the ſaddeſt ſubiect that euer I beheld) may proue wholeſome and fruitful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me.</p>
                  <p>Thus<note n="a" place="margin">Verſe 22 In al this did not Iob ſinn nor charge God fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly.</note> he that is almighty, as he turneth all thinges, (though the meanes ſeeme neuer ſo contrarie) to his owne glory: ſo maketh he whatſoeuer rough and hard vſage of his (notwithſtanding the harſhnes of the courſe to our thinking) redound to the good of his elect. Vnleſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will deny the Lorde his due, with hold from him his right, be vnreaſonable not to ſee, vnthankefull not to acknowledge his goodneſſe; we muſt not be vnmindful to render him<note n="b" place="margin">bleſſed bee the name of the lord. v, 21</note> praiſe, nor forgetful to bleſſe him with mind and voice, no not for his greateſt ſeuerity in our chaſtice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

                  <p>Lying is thy old trade, &amp; of thy own inuention: yet who ſo forward to lay it vpon another as thou, herewith I haue beene well acquainted heretofore: but as for thine intreaty vnto me that is more rare. What can Sathan intreat, Is he become a ſuppliant? Is it poſſible that he which was wont to be at defiance with his maker ſhould now ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? But euer marke this, it is for ſome aduantage to himſelfe, otherwiſe he would neuer bee bent againſt his nature and haughty ſpirit, to be ſo courteous. Sathan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe can be kind to get commodity: but alas ſilly Serpent, how he is to ſeeke in his owne occupation wherein he is ſo ancient, and how he begs for a whip to beate himſelfe?

                  <p>It is wonderfull how this ſetteth me an edge, and how ſwiftly it carrieth me about my worke; And the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the party is againſt whom I am ſent, the more hotly do I

Howbeit in regard of our daies they were long, and many: and therefore whereas by meanes of the ſhortneſſe of our life wee fee not the ryſing and fall of the wicked and their poſterity, they liuing long ſaw it. Beſide, the Lord who talked familiarly with them, reuealed his will vnto them in more ſpeciall manner then vnto vs: and further being ſo graue and of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wiſedome, (through long practiſe) they would not be raſh, nor ouerſeene in their cenſure.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14506:38"/>where hee groweth, is a pleaſant and fruitfull ſoile, well manured, watered with the liuing ſpring of the Lords bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and he is deepely rooted in the bankes thereof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a<note n="a" place="margin">Verſe xvii</note> craggy Rocke, into which his roote windeth it ſelfe, and ſo his braunches, are diffuſed, farre and neare.

It is not then for any one to gaine ſay, but in al ſubmiſſion to yeild vnto him. And there is a neceſsity in it to; for if the excellency of his wiſedome and the vnſearchablenes thereof, wil not bring me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcend; his ſtrong arme wil preſſe them vnto it perforce: neither ſhal they find either peace of conſcience to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, or any outward comfort, vntil they ceaſe their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and becom obedient.

                  <p>When he cauſeth the ſunne<note n="f" place="margin">verſe 7</note> to ſhine moſt gloriouſly in the firmament in the day, guiding thereby the worlde, and deuiding the times, and the Moone by her light to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the darkenes of the night; and theſe both, euen as if they were ſealed vp to withdraw their ſhining at his beck. When he ſtretcheth out the heauens as a goodly<note n="g" place="margin">verſe 8</note> Canopie ouer the whole face of the earth, and walking amidſt the vntamed waues of the raging ſea, apeaſeth the fury ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

                     <hi>Arcturus, Orion, Pleiades,</hi> the <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi> of the South anſwering thereunto, whoſe diuers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences worke the diuerſity of theſe foure ſeaſons.</p>
                  <p>This is the Lordes doing to gouerne the earth below,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14506:39"/>by the firmament which is aboue, and to giue names to all the hoaſt of Heauen, and to appoint to euery ſtarre his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and courſe, and likewiſe his operation in thoſe inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or bodies. Thus<note n="i" place="margin">Verſe x</note> is the Lord, wonderful in his waies, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch, as neither can bee numbred nor found out: ſo difficult and hidden are his Councels, that though he ſet them before our eyes,<note n="k" place="margin">Verſe xi</note> and bring them home vnto our view, yet can we not comprehend them. Wherefore, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as it ſhal ſeeme good vnto him to take any mans ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from him, or his life, who ſhal compel him that is of that mightie power, to make reſtitution?

Neither doeth the ſuppoſition of his will, derogate any thing from the maner and rule of his Iuſtice.</p>
                  <p>For albeit it bee his will and pleaſure to afflict vs, yet is not this wil of his tyranical and vniuſt: becauſe, it is neuer ſeuered from the attributes of his Wiſedome, Equity, Mercy, Goodnes, and Patience, whereby he is inclinable in his Diuine nature, which is vnchangeable to nothing, but that which is right, and in ſuch ſort to, as he cannot be drawne to the contrary, or to ought that ſwarueth but the bredth of a naile therefrom.</p>
                  <p>To let fly his anger<note n="m" place="margin">Verſe xii</note> againſt the ſtrong and haughty of ſpirit, with their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plices &amp; coadiutors of al ſorts, declareth his Noble valor and puiſance, and that he is a worthy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, not fearing the faces of the mightieſt and proudeſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary, but dareth encounter him with his confederates, how venturous, how reſolute, how well prouided, howe ſtrongely combined ſoeuer he be?

                  <p>Here is no iniquity in this, but moſt perfect equity, that

                  <p>ADmit I were free from all ſpot of ſinne in mine owne ſight,<note place="margin">chap. 9. xv.</note> yet would I not (neither was it euer in my mind heere to fore (though thou laieſt it to my charge Bildad)<note n="❀ a" place="margin">chap 8, 3</note> to ſtriue with my maker about my integrity: but rather, to ſue vnto him that is my indge for mercy. For, ſhall he that is arraigned at the bar, be at variance with him that hath his life in his hands? The Iudge can better skil of the law then the Priſoner can, and ſeeth him faulty and culpable, where hee leaſt ſuſpecteth; hath ſundrie accuſations againſt him, and many waies to condemn him which he neuer dreamed of. But graunt I were of that minde, and that the Lorde would yeelde vnto mee ſo farre, to ſuffer mee to plead my cauſe before him, and maintaine my innocency; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the dread of his maieſty woulde ſtrike ſuch a horror and trembling into me, that I should not be able to do it.

                     <hi>ELiphaz</hi> ſhewed thee, that thy affliction was a ſigne that thou wert wicked,<note place="margin">Chap. xi</note> and proued the ſame vnto thee very copiouſly, by the puniſhment of the euill liuing in all ages; and on the contrary, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes that follow the good. <hi>Bildad</hi> added vnto that, that the good are ſometimes afflicted as well as the bad, but to their greater preferment, and that they might receiue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their amendment, larger bleſſinges then before: and further, that if ſo bee the vngodly flourish a while, yet at length they come to deſtruction, becauſe their faire shew of goodneſſe which they made vnto the Worlde, was but counterfeit. Now I will annexe a third pointe: namely, that the wiſedome of the Lorde in his waies is aboue our capacity, and that for this cauſe, though thou <hi>Iob</hi> ſeeſt not where in thou haſt offended the Lord, yet he hath obſerued many defects and declinings in thee. But before I enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14506:45"/>it, I muſt reprehend thee for thy much babling; and then for iuſtifying thy ſelfe before God.</p>
                  <p>Is this tollerable, that thou ſholdeſt carry away the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and gaine the cauſe by<note n="a" place="margin">Verſe 2</note> multiplying of wordes: and thoſe idle ones to; in ſubſtance vntrue, ſpoken by way of deriſion,<note n="b" place="margin">Verſe 3 For ſo ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <hi>Subſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> Hebr, tilahag of Lahag.</note> and receiue no anſwere from vs to checke thy folly, that with bended browes makeſt a mocke at him? There is no wiſedome nor vertue in vſing ſo much talke, and leſſe wiſedome, and very little honeſty ſhould there be in vs, if we ſhould diſſemble it, and let thee alone in it. There is no profit in it, for it will not make thee iuſt neuer the ſooner: nay, the matter of it is vniuſt, and therefore to aſſent vnto it, were to yeald and ſubſcribe (as it were) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to blaſphemy, which is impoſſible for the truely vertuous and Godly euer to do.</p>
                  <p>This is one of thyſ peeches,<note n="c" place="margin">Verſe 4</note> (and this is the point I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to handle.) What I do teach, ſpeake, or thinke, there can be no fault found in it, and why? My conſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth mee not of tranſgreſſion, neither can Men accuſe me, and thus thou diſputeſt with the Lord; imagining thy ſelfe to haue acceſſe vnto him. But when thou ſhalt haue a day of hearing<note n="d" place="margin">Verſe 4</note> before him indeed, it will be otherwiſe with thee then thou ſuppoſeſt. Thy puritie, innocency, and iuſtice, will not goe for paiement. Thou boaſteſt how well thou art ſeen in thee deep &amp; abſtruſe<note n="e" place="margin">Verſe 5</note> wiſedome of God, and that thou performeſt all which hee requireth of thee, when in truth the duty the Lord calleth for, is much greater then wee coniecture, and iuſtice in his vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding farre aboue that we thinke it to be, and therefore pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is in an higher degree, and more<note n="f" place="margin">Verſe 6</note> ſeuerity to be inflicted vpon vs, then we make account off, if hee ſhould lay it vppon vs accordingly as wee faile in the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of righteouſneſſe, which he in his wiſedome, and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty exacteth.</p>
                  <p>The debt which we owe we ſhall neuer bee able to pay vnto him, vnleſſe he remit much more then he conſtraineth vs to giue in. That which God hath not<note n="g" place="margin">verſe 7</note> reuealed, is much
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14506:46"/>more then that which hee hath reuealed according to that which is in his reuealed will, thou deſerueſt puniſhment: what then ſhould become of thee if he ſhould deale with thee according to his reuealed will? Euen this thy puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Iob,</hi> as iuſt as thou thinkeſt thy ſelfe, and as great and intollerable as thou reputeſt of it, for the payment of the dew debt which the Lord in his exact account reckoneth to belong vnto him, is tenne times leſſe how extreame ſoeuer, then that which he might iuſtly lay vpon thee. And if he ſhall at any time, (as I<note n="❀ a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Supra</hi> v. 5.</note> wiſh hee would) ſubmit himſelfe to debate the matter with thee, no queſtion but that he would condemne thee alſo to more bitter afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then this thou now indureſt, and that for thy ſins, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further reſpect, vnleſſe bewayling thy former waies, thou ſue to him for mercy. Heereunto thou canſt not bee perſwaded, and therefore troubleſt thy head to finde out ſome other cauſe of thine affliction then thy ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>The generall and vndoubted cauſe of all calamity is ſin, and what intention ſoeuer beſide, the Lord hath in it, yet that is the maine and principall; for without it, miſery had neuer had any being: this the Lord hath reuealed vnto vs to be the cauſe of diſtreſſe, let vs admit of it therefore, and leaue to ſtudy what other drift the Lord may peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture haue in it, vntill it ſhall pleaſe him to lay it open vnto vs: when we haue tyred our ſelues about other reſpectes, they will proue vncertaine and doubtfull, ſuch, for which we haue no ſure ground, neither can wee reſt vpon them. They will proue dangerous vnto vs, becauſe ſecretes and ſuch as the Lord would not haue knowen, and ſo, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vs; euen as Paradice, into which no man may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the Aungels with their flaming Sworde, will fley him.</p>

                  <p>MOreouer it is a more impoſſibility to climbe into<note n="a" place="margin">Chap. 11. verſe 8.</note> Gods boſome, to know what he doth there deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. If it weremans counſell that he would find out, there
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14506:46"/>were ſome likelihood in it, for that he is like vnto vs, and we haue reaſon and vnderſtanding to guid vs vnto it, aſwel as he. But God is vnlike vs, eternall, immortall, inuiſible, vnſearchable in his iudgementes, and in his counſels, and his wayes are paſt finding out. He is omnipotent, al ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and abſolute in power: and we altogither inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to any thing.</p>
                  <p>So that we want the meanes to come to that which is in him, he hath denyed it vs, and of our ſelues weare nothing; of that impotency and imperfection in nature, that our eyes dazell at the beholding of the Sunne, how then is it poſſible that wee ſhould behold his glory? Our dulnes is ſuch, that wee cannot conceiue of thoſe thinges which the Lord hath layed before our eyes: moſt vnfit then and vnable are we, to aſcend vp to thoſe high myſteries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into he hath giuen vs no light.</p>
                  <p>We attaine not to the perfect knowledge of the heauens<note n="b" place="margin">verſe 9.</note> which we daily behold, nor of the center and bowels of the earth which we daily tread vppon; nor of the length of the ſame, nor of the breadth of the Ocean; neither is it poſſible for vs to doe it, neuer any man hath or ſhall be able to find it out. They that haue ſpent their time in it, haue laboured in vaine, becauſe the Lord will not ſuffer it to be knowen. Some that haue attempted it, haue come to confuſion, that others myght feare to enterprize the like.</p>
                  <p>If therefore the wit of Man cannot reach ſo high, as to comprehend the wiſedome of God in the Heauens, of what diſtance they are from the earth, but by coniecture: what is the number of the Starres, what is their big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, what excellency and beauty there is in them; nor his wiſedome in the earth, to know exactly how deep, or how long it is, how to digge through it, or how to finde out the laſt borders of it; nor his wiſedome in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the huge Sea, to ſay that it conſiſteth of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Leagues, or elſe ſtretcheth ſo far to the Weſt, and ſo farre vnto the Eaſt; heere the South Sea endeth, or

Is it not a mere madnes once to immagin that, that other wiſedome of his, (in the forknowledge of thinges, decree vppon them, diſpoſing of them, drift in them, their vpſhotte and end, which hee reſerueth as a prerogatiue to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe aboue his creatures, communicating them to none, no not to the bleſſed Angels,) ſhold by our ſearch and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie into them be obtained?

Wee maruell at his iudgements when they fall vpon vs, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we haue not deſerued them, but he ſeeing<note n="d" place="margin">verſe xi</note> corruption in the heart, (albeit it appeare not outwardly) and wee diſſemble, he cannot diſſemble, but muſt needes, (becauſe he cannot abide that wickednes ſhould goe vnpuniſhed,) reproue vs for it, &amp; ſcourge vs too, if his reproof wil not ſerue the turn: Here by making vs to ſee, that wer as blind<note n="e" place="margin">Him that vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth nothing v, xi</note> as Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles before: to vnderſtand, that were not onely without vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but void of a heart capable of vnderſtanding; and by nature, as vnteachable, and vntractable as the foal<note n="f" place="margin">verſe xii</note> of a wilde Aſſe (which of al Beaſtes is moſt blockiſh, and vntoward.)</p>
                  <p>Conſider thou this, and let this his ſcourge vpon thee, (al ſtubbornneſſe in defending thine innocency being laied aſide) be a meanes to mollifie thy harde heart, and ſtrike it with compunction for ſinne, mooue thee with voice and mind lifted vp, armes ſtretched out, hands ſpredde abroad, to ſeeke the Lorde and call vppon him: which that it may bee effectuall, prepare thy hart,<note n="g" place="margin">verſe xiii</note> and diſpoſe it who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereunto.</p>

                  <p>And moreouer purge thy<note n="h" place="margin">verſe xiiii</note> hands from iniquity, iniurie, deceit, oppreſſion, and if there bee any thing within thy Walles, or in thy poſſeſſion, that thou haſt wrongfully got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, make ſatisfaction and reſtitution for it.

                  <p>YE thinke your ſelues the onely wiſemen in the worlde,<note n="a" place="margin">Chap. 12. verſe 2.</note> and that you haue al knowledge cloſed vppe in your owne breſts. For you could not ſet a better face vppon the matter, if you repreſented the Perſons of al the greateſt, learned, and moſt expert Diuines vppon the face of the earth. You ſuppoſe belike that your heades alone are the ſtorehouſes of heauenly Doctrin, and beſide it there is none to be found among men, and that therefore you dying, all learning should die with you: otherwiſe you would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ſo highly of your owne, and ſo baſely of other mens guiftes.</p>
                  <p>But euen in mine knowledge<note n="b" place="margin">verſe 3.</note> (of whome you make ſmal account) is nothing inferiour to yours: and there is no man ſo ignorant, but conceiueth as much as you haue ſpoken, that reckon your ſelues ſuch great Clarkes.</p>
                  <p>This therefore is to be reprehended in you. Firſt, in that you conceiue ſo wel of your ſelues, and prefer your ſelues before others, when there is no cauſe of the one, nor of the other. Secondly, in that your are ſo voide of honeſty, to deride<note n="c" place="margin">verſe 4.</note> a man that is you old friend and companion, ſo deepe in the Lords Bookes that he anſwereth his requeſts, and one that is a plaine harted man, ſincere in his religion, and iuſt toward men.

                  <p>Fourthly, you are to be reprehended, in that you are ſo abſurd, to denie that which you behold daily with your eies (which euen the verie fowles<note n="❀ e" place="margin">Verſe 7</note> of the Heauen, the brute Beaſts, the dumbe Fiſhes, the ſenceleſſe Earth, are able to teach you (if they could ſpeake) namely, that vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vniuſt men (incenſing the Lord againſt them by their iniquity) liue<note n="f" place="margin">Verſe 6</note> according to their hearts deſire, abound in wealth, honour, peace, and the greateſt ſecurity that may be heere in this life, and the godlie and iuſt oftentimes, (if not for the moſt part) liue in dishonor, miſerie and trouble, hauing the world frowning vpon them. In this the ſenſible and inſenſible creatures would inſtruct you (I ſaie) if they wanted not ſpeech to vtter it, and they vtter it foorth too in their kind, though not in a ſillabical ſound of words, that the Lord being creator of the<note n="i" place="margin">Or liues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>anima vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiua, ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis,</hi> and warranted by the 10. verſe of this chapter.</note> ſoules of all the liuing, and of thoſe Diuine ſpirits of men, may diſpoſe of them at his pleaſure, giue them their portion, what qualities ſoeuer he hath indued them withall, as liketh him beſt; appointing the better ſort to affliction (if hee will) and the worſe to proſperity, or otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Thou art very eloquent <hi>Zophar,</hi> and profounde<note n="* k" place="margin">chap 11.8 <hi>at ſequent</hi>

For the ſea, which in nature is a more noble element, is putte into a more baſe and ignominious place, and the earth which is much leſſe Noble, is ſeated in a more
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14506:49"/>higher roome: this, if there were nothing elſe, ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your aſſertion, that euery Man flouriſheth in the world according to his goodneſſe, and he that is afflicted cannot be a godly man.</p>
                  <p>There wanteth therefore iudgement in thee to diſcerne of thinges aright. The eare is made not onely to heare, but to alow,<note n="h" place="margin">verſe xi</note> and diſalow of that which it heareth thereafter as it is: the palat, not onely to taſt, but to put a difference betweene ſweete and ſowre, holſome and vnholſome meates.

                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> his antiquity therefore is nothing to his, that is the ancient of daies and antiquity it ſelfe; and his iudgement grounded vpon the experiment of a few particular exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and thoſe alſo peraduenture miſtaken to, is of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew to his, that is the iudge of the whole earth, and before all times.

                  <p>Very intemperate therefore and raſh is thy cenſure in this, for what man (wel aduiſed) would vndertake to iudge before hand what the Lord is about to do, being of that aboundant mercie as he is, though the matter were cleare to thy thinking: much leſſe then in a doubtfull point, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the conſcience of a man, and ſuch a one, as both is blameleſſe to the world, and proteſteth his ſincerity.

                  <p>This maketh me to be weary of diſputing with you, and to deſire to propound my cauſe vnto the Lord,<note n="a" place="margin">verſe 13</note> whome I know (notwithſtanding thy words) will not condemne me for an Hippocrite, or for an extraordinary wicked man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my extraordinaiy punniſhment (which is thy ground) as thou ouer-boldly doth auouch.

                  <p>Hereupon you inferre, that the Lord punniſhing mee in the ſeuereſt maner, I muſt needs be an extreame and groſſe offender; Which ground of yours, (though I haue before confuted,) yet you ſtill maintaine, and condemne mee as one ſtriuing to ouerthrow Gods Iuſtice, in that I labour to defend my innocency.

Theſe be your groundes, theſe the weapons of your Warfare againſt me, yet notwithſtanding, with theſe, though like vnto a ruſty blade in a painted ſheath, you haue made ſuch a flouriſh, as though you would make the ſtanders by beleeue, you contend for Gods right: But let God alone with his right, hee is able to defend it without your falſe grounds, without your wreſting of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters otherwiſe then they are ment; without your neate ſtile, witty inuention, cunning applycation of doctrines; true in themſelues, to the condemnation of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                  <p>You greatly miſtake the matter; he will not robbe his Children of thoſe vertues he hath beſtowed vppon them, thereby to iuſtifie himſelfe, he hath other meanes to doe it then ſo: But do ye not (thinke yee) while ye take from me my iuſtice, rob God of his? For being the God of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, he doth cloth his ſeruants with the robe of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which whoſoeuer taketh from them, hee holdeth as an iniury done vnto himſelfe.

An other reaſon why I am weary in contending with you is, becauſe your diſputation is vaine, and to as little purpoſe, as your comming to me at the firſt: wherein though your meaning were to comfort me, yet you do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe: You are like thoſe Phyſitians<note n="c" place="margin">And all you are Phyſitians of no valew.

The ſweete promiſes of the Meſſiah, the onely ſeaſonable and ſoueraign medicine to an humble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is quite ſwept away out of your remembrance.

He that loueh his Prince will not deface his picture. Muſt God haue fauour ſhewed him in iudgment, or elſe will his cauſe fall to the ground? That which God forbid deth toward men, will he haue extended toward himſelfe, that his<note n="g" place="margin">Verſe 8</note> perſon may be accepted more then his right requireth?

                  <p>You charge me with hypocriſie: There is Hypocriſie in you, in arguing thus againſt your conſcience. This conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of yours he will lay open and naked at the length, to your ſhame.

Such will be the Lordes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in iudgment to them that tranſgreſſe.</p>
                  <p>You ſeeme not to be touched at al with this, neither with the excellency of his glory, to the which the beſt things<note n="l" place="margin">verſe 12</note> that belong vnto men, as wealth, honour, credit, grauity, and wiſedome, are as the duſt and dung vnder our feete.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14506:54"/>the moſt comely countenance among you all, is but of clay and earth, which being conſidered, cauſeth me to muſe the more at your boldneſſe of ſpeech: for duſt and aſhes to approch before the immortall God, without due reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his maieſty, is not to be borne withall; but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in his preſence falſehood and wrong, to diſſemble in your tongue, and yet to thinke to make all good with this apology; <hi>We haue done it to maintaine thy right,</hi> is ſuch impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, as cannot be expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>This impudency of yours, maketh me deſirous to be rid of you; that ſo I might argue my cauſe alone before the Lord without enterruption.

Were your liues in your handes, as it is in the Prouerbe, wherein wee can
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14506:55"/>account nothing ſafe, as being ſubiect to marring, looſing, taking away, and miſcarrying twenty wales, woulde you thinke there were any other waye but one with you? I nouriſh in me no other kinde of deſpaire then this, that I haue no hope to liue; and for this you condemne mee as a diſtruſtfull perſon, and a man without al hope of ſaluation, which you gather from my pittifull crying out, by reaſon of the extremity of my diſeaſe: concluding thereupon, as if I were ſo inraged, that I did gnawe my fleſh, beate my ſelfe with my fiſts, knocke my head againſt the wall like a Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem or Franticke man; and thus were become an executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of my bodie, and a Butcher of myne owne life, and for that <hi>I</hi> cal vpon the Lord to iudge my cauſe, a traitor to mine owne ſoule.</p>
                  <p>But I would haue you know, that in the battle betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit, though the inner man bee not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, yet in the beſt of the Lordes ſouldiors it is ſoiled of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes by the outward man: So then, albeit I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued many a wound by my fleſh, whereby I haue bin ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time brought to miſdemeane my ſelfe in this my combat, yet <hi>I</hi> haue helde mine owne ſtill, I haue reſerued my heart from yeilding, yea my faith is as ſtrong ſtil (notwithſtanding ſo many afflictions one in the neck of another) as euer it was. All the miſeries and torments in the world, could not draw mee to deſpaire, nor drawe mee from that truſt<note n="b" place="margin">verſe 15</note> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence I haue in my God, concerning a better eſtate after this life: and as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning my recouery again here in this life I doubt not of the power of God: but be cauſe of the weake and vnrecouerable eſtate of my body, in the ſight of fleſh and blood, it ſeemeth to me to be his decree to take me out of this vale of miſery: And hereevpon I perſwade my ſelfe that it cannot be auoided, but that I muſt needs go the way of all the liuing.</p>
                  <p>You further obiect, that I haue no regard of my life, nor of my ſoule, when the greateſt regard that I can haue concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe, is to labor for faith in the Lords promiſes, which is my continuall practiſe, and whereby I haue gained this

                  <p>This anſwereth to your reprehenſion,<note n="*d" place="margin">chap, 4. v. 5.6.</note> 
                     <hi>As is a mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and life, ſo is his hope;</hi> but my hope you ſee is great, and therefore I conclude from your owne ground, that my reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hath not bin counterfet as you immagine, but ſound and ſincere: nor my life wicked, but godly and vertuous: namely, ſuch as hath proceeded from a liuely faith and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt hope in the Lord, with loue of his name, and zeale of his glory, which haue euer bin accounted as the onely true markes both of the one and of the other. This is that which I haue ſtood vpon al this while, that I haue ſought the lord and his honour in all my actions, and ſerued him with my whole hart; and hereupon would I ſtill ſtand, were death to ceaze vpon me by and by, and were I now to yeelde forth my laſt breath. This is my confeſſion, no other but this ſhall be wrung from me.</p>
                  <p>My innocency in the matters whereof you accuſe mee is that I ſtriue for, and were I nowe about to render my ſoule into the hands of my Creator, this is it I would craue at his hands, the arbitrating and compounding of this controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie betweene vs.</p>
                  <p>Now for the carriage of my ſelfe in this my preſent viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; thus much I may truely ſay for my ſelfe, that thogh my conflict hath bin long and bitter, yet the Lorde of his goodnes hath ſo kept me, that I haue not fallen from him. I haue indeed offended againſt his Maieſty with my toong, and failed of my dutie many waies, but he which is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of ſuch as truſt in him, hath kept my heart vpright: and I doubt not but he will ſo keepe it to the end, and place in it ſuch a confidence in his mercies, in the midſt of death, that Sathan (whoſe inſtrumentes you now are) and whoſe part you take in this diſputation, with all his policie, ſhall not be able to ſurprize the iuuincible Caſtle of my hope.</p>
                  <p>Were <hi>I</hi> an Hippocrite (according as you accuſe<note n="★ e" place="margin">chap. 8.13.</note> me) <hi>I</hi> could not bee thus confident: For, hee that is ſuch a one,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14506:56"/>dares not come to his tryal, he had rather that all the world had his cauſe in handling, then the Lorde; for he knowes that he will lay open the Booke of his conſcience, which is as a filthy skie full fraught with deceit, lying, diſſembling, impiety, and vngodlines: and diſcouer with the brightnes of his preſence, the deeds that are done in the night, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes thereof, together with the deteſtable affections, deſires, and cogitations of the ſame, and with all make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to the eles of all men what a monſter hee is become, that outwardly is a louer ofreligion and vertue, but inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a mortall hater of them both.</p>
                  <p>I feare none of al this, which maketh me ſo forward and earneſt with the Lord to take the cauſe into his own hands: But what maketh you ſo plentiful in diſſwading from this courſe? Is it not the contrary; namely, a diſtruſt that you haue in your cauſe, a guilty conſcience that you haue not dealte faithfully and according to your hart, in that you haue ſo vehemently vrged againſt me, and a feare that you ſhould receiue a checke for your vnkind and vndiſcreet behauiour toward me: as alſo for the application of al your doctrines, true in themſelues for the moſt part, vntruely and wronge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to my perſon? But meethinkes I ſee you relent, when you heare me thus confident and bolde in my cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Heare<note n="f" place="margin">Verſe 17.</note> me therefore diligently with your ears, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well in your minds, what I am able further to ſay for my ſelfe, not againſt the Lord (as you would haue it) for his righteouſnes and truth I reuerence, but againſt your accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; and I doubt<note n="g" place="margin">Verſe 18.</note> not, but I ſhal make you yeeld much more vnto me; Eſpecially, if <hi>I</hi> may haue the mannaging of my cauſe, the ordering and diſpoſing of my reaſons my ſelf, and the information which I giue in, ſhal bee taken and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
                  <p>Before the Lord I would anſwere for my ſelfe, becauſe none dare gainſay his Verdict, being iudge of althe world, becauſe no controuerſie can haue a final end vntil he diſcide it, either by himſelfe, his worde, or his Oracles; and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when he hath had the handlig of it, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil preſume

Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til my cauſe be tryed before him, it ſtandeth me vpon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my innocency in thoſe things you obiect againſt mee, while I liue: For if I ſhould not ſo do, but hold my peace, and ſay nothing for my ſelfe, greef would break my hart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of while I thus largely ſpeak for my ſelfe, I feel great eaſe to my ſoule. And further, by my ſilence I might weaken my cauſe, and offer iniurie vnto the truth.

                  <p>The cauſe hereof is, the accuſtoming &amp; delighting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

A wicked Man is hee, that is without faith, and hee is a godly man that is indued therewith: for the want of faith is it that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemneth, and the inioying thereof, that only iuſtifieth a man: Becauſe al the ſins in the world cannot condemne a man where faith is, nor al the good works in the world can ſaue a man where faith is not: becauſe no prayer, no prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is pleaſing to the Lord without ſacrifice in theſe daies, which leadeth vs to faith in the redeemer to come. No tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion or offence ſo great, but is purged thereby, becauſe faith can no more be without good fruits, then fire without heat, or water without moyſture, nor good works where faith is wanting, any more then light appeare in the world the Sunne being taken out of the firmament; or life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the body, the ſoule beeing ſeperated from it.</p>

As therefore when the ſacrifices are layed vppon the Altar, the fire commeth downe from heauen and conſumeth them, it is an euident and infallible ſigne of the Lordes preſence; ſo, where faith inflameth the heart, with aſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt expectation of the Lords deliuerance from death and deſtruction, there doubtleſſe is a ſure and certaine teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his feare and freedome from the bondage of ſinne and Wickedneſſe: ſo that it raigneth not in his mortall body (whoſoeuer he be.)</p>
                  <p>For this faith it is neuerydle, neuer ſo litarie, but alwaies in building and repairing of the Temple where it abideth, that ſo it may befit for the receiuing of her honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer when hee commeth: alwaies attended with ſuch royal vertues, as may grace it in the eyes of him that cannot indure iniquity.</p>

Be it that their ſinnes haue remained with them a longe time, and that they bee ſo ſweete, that they cannot leaue<note n="l" place="margin">chap, 20, 11, 12, 13</note> them, they become not withſtanding at length as deadly as the poiſon of Aſpes, or the ſting of the tongue of the Viper vnto them. The Hippocrite and wicked muſt not looke alwaies to flow in wealth, neither when he is once downe, by all his labor to recouer his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eſtate: for how ſhould he ſtil proſper that hath inriched himſelfe by oppreſſion<note n="m" place="margin">verſe 15, 16 17, 18, 19 <hi>et ſequent.</hi>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:14506:69"/>poore of their foode, ſo ſhall hee periſh for want of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment: and though he haue aboundance, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he ſhall not be ſatiſfied. When he hath prouided for his belly, the wrath of the Lord ſhall ſcatter it, and he ſhall be diſappointed: if he flye the Bow, the Sword, fire, and deſtruction are prepared for him. If there be none to witneſſe againſt him, the Heauens,<note n="k" place="margin">Verſe 27.28</note> and earth themſelues will lay him open, the Stones and Walles crye out againſt him; the Rocks, Woods, &amp; Mountaines, where he wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, wil giue forth an <hi>Eccho</hi> for the bringing of his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe to light.

That which thou af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeſt of the wicked, is not alwaies true: becauſe for the moſt part they themſelues al their life time, their Children, and Childrens Children greatly flouriſh in the world. And though it be ſo, that he puniſheth the wicked oftentimes, yet he will not bee preſcribed by Men, when, or how, or vpon what cauſe to do it: being done, he hideth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the grounds therof, &amp; reſerueth it to the laſt iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which is done to reſtrain vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> raſh iudging.

                  <p>In that I complaine<note n="a" place="margin">Chap. 23 Verſe 2</note> becauſe of my griefe, I am thought to rebell againſt God. O<note n="b" place="margin">Verſe 3, 4, 5</note> that I might once be admitted to the preſence of the Lord to plead my cauſe. I know<note n="c" place="margin">ver. 6, 10, 11 12.</note> aſſuredly, that for the gouernment of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth he would not diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend me, and ſo for the reſt of my actions: For ſuch ſpeed well that come before him, which haue endeuored<note n="d" place="margin">Verſe 7</note> to frame their liues anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his will. You take vpon you to determine of the cauſe of my puniſhment, not conſidering that the Lorde doth not ordinarily<note n="e" place="margin">Verſe 8, 9</note> reueale the cauſe of his puniſhments to the deareſt of his ſeruantes: Notwithſtanding, you are ſuch as will preſcribe him a rule how, and for what hee muſt puniſh, and a time likewiſe when he ſhall do it, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe expreſly hypocriſie,<note n="❀ f" place="margin">Chap. 22 Verſe 6, 7, 8</note> cruelty, oppreſſion,<note n="* g" place="margin">Cha. 22.13</note> impiety againſt God, as the ſinnes for which he now puniſheth me.</p>
                  <p>If you obſerue well the Lordes dealing againſt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, you ſhall find it to bee in another ſort then hee hath dealt with me, for he ſuffereth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very long to continue in their wicked courſe, and to offend againſt him with an high hand, committing ſin vpon ſin, vntill their iniquities make ſtrong cryes in his eares, (as did the olde world), be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he commeth againſt them in iudgement, and he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warneth them likewiſe of their deſtruction before it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. Whereas on the other ſide, hee taketh his Children napping, when they make their firſt entrance into tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. All which pleadeth for me that I haue not beene a notorious offender, for I haue not beene admoniſhed by the Lord at any time of my tranſgreſſion, but comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14506:70"/>and encouraged by him in my courſe, no Man hath cryed vnto the Lord againſt me.</p>
                  <p>The Lords diſpleaſure hath appeared vnto me by no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer affliction, neither if I had bin afflicted by him, ſhould it neceſſarily follow that he was therefore angry with me: For he neuer chaſtiſeth his children in his anger, but in his loue, alwaies in his mercy, how ſeuerely ſoeuer he ſeemeth to correct them, not at all in his fury and wrath, for then he ſhoulde vtterly conſume them which he neuer doth. True it is, that the Lord fauoreth a whole kingdome for a righteous mans ſake, and that at his ſuite and petition it is redeemed from deſtruction; but this is no certaine rule with him: at his pleaſure he will do it, and if he haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined<note n="h" place="margin">verſe 13.14</note> the contrary, many, yea, multitudes of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes aſſembled together to intreate him, may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with him. Nay ſo farre are they in preuailing for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by their ſupplications, that they themſelues<note n="* i" place="margin">Dauid. Pſ. 69, 3. Ieremy 10, 24</note> (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their often and earneſt prayers) are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to indure affliction for a longe time together, and ſo long indeed oftentimes, that there ſeemeth to be no hope at all for their reliefe.</p>
                  <p>The wicked they oppreſſe them, holde them in miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeruitude many yeares togther, whole Cittyes and Countries they ſpoyle at their peleaſure: ſhewing no pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the fatherleſſe,<note n="k" place="margin">verſe 3</note> ſtaruing the poore,<note n="l" place="margin">Verſe 4, 9.</note> murdering the rich, waſting &amp; deuouring all with Fire and Sword, where they cannot otherwiſe bring the people into ſubiection: Yet the Lorde ſuffereth all this, nothing regardeth their loud cries,<note n="m" place="margin">Verſe 12</note> nothing eſteemeth their pittifull wronges, be they neuer ſo many, neuer ſo vertuous, neuer ſo deuoted to his obedience, neuer ſo ſtedfaſt in faith, and depending vpon his aſſiſtance. Hereby it is euident, that we cannot diſcerne of the Lordes iudgments, the variety of them is ſo great, that we are not able to doe it, were they layed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen before our eyes, and ſuch as might be attained to, the diuerſity of them would cauſe vs oftentimes to faile.</p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:14506:71"/>
                  <p>But the Lord hiding them from vs of ſet purpoſe, howe can it be choſen but that we ſhould erre in our Verdict? For, what he intendeth by them, is one of his waies which is paſt our finding out, and whether they come in his loue, or in his indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a ſecret which he reſerueth to himſelf, &amp; reuea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth not to the lookers on:<note place="margin">The ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this chapt. is ſufficiently vnfolded, the drift laid out: thogh it acor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>actly with the verſes of the chapter, &amp; ſo of the former: neither is that largenes need full now as in the begining both the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kers and mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter being the ſame.</note> they which feele them vnderſtand better then the beholders, how it fareth with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Howbeit, theſe alſo haue no further ſight into them then for their own particular eſtate, how it will go with them after this life. For ſome the Lord iudgeth heere, that he may ſaue them in the life to come, with ſome he beginneth his iudgements heere in this life, and proceedeth with them afterward to further condemnation: whether of theſe two wayes the Lorde ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth with them, is beſt knowne vnto themſelues, others are not able to define. The ſum of all is this, the Lord beeing a free agent, will not bee tyed to any one ſet courſe of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, but will bee at his choyſe to diſpoſe of euery acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on according to his wil: ſometimes hee wil reuenge the blood of the innocents; and ſometimes he will not do it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the end of all things: ſometimes the wicked go vnpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and ſometimes he powreth foorth his wrath vppon them heere in this life.

                  <p>THat I may begin therefore,<note place="margin">Chap, 27</note> with a confutation of your aſſertions, whereas you condemne mee for an Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite and vile perſon, becauſe of the greatnes of my calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: to that I anſwere, that affliction is common both to the good and bad, and that the righteous cannot bee diſcerned thereby from the vnrighteous, neither by a proſperous and happy eſtate, neither is the Lordes loue or hatted to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued according in the degrees of theſe. But if wee will heere diſtinguiſh aright, we muſt looke to the demeanor, and to the diſpoſing of the mind in the one, and in the other; and what vſe they make of the lotte and portion whatſoeuer it is that the Lord meaſureth out vnto them. And if it be in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of paine and greefe, with what patience they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to beare it, and what hope and confidence they haue in the Lords mercies, being in the midſt thereof, and euen at the point of death.</p>
                  <p>The Hippocrite,<note n="a" place="margin">verſe 8</note> and vngodly perſon in ſuch a caſe, or if he ſuſtaine loſſe in his outward eſtate (in regarde whereof he made ſome ſhew of ſhrowding himſelfe vnder the Lords wing, while his fauor therein ſhined vpon him) he is by and by at deſpaire with himſelfe, and his hope is vtterly at an end. And therefore he can no more pray vnto God, he can no more delight in his word, he can no longer depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, no longer expect any good at his hands. Hee may<note n="b" place="margin">verſe 9</note> cry vnto the Lord (becauſe of the greatnes of his ſorrow, <hi>I</hi> will not deny) but all in vaine, for that he neuer walked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him with an vpright hart, and neuer had any true ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his mercies, but ſought onely vnder the coulour of godlines, to gaine vnto himſelfe theſe temporall riches, without any reſpect at all, eyther to the Lords honour, the good of his brethren, or the well-fare of his owne ſoule.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:14506:74"/>Howbeit this crying cannot properly be tearmed a prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, becauſe he that properly and truely prayeth,<note n="* b" place="margin">Hebr. 11, 6</note> belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that the Lord is both able and willing to yeald him his help, &amp; to reward him that ſeeketh vnto him: For this cauſe, he that is godly indeed, though he be ſtripped of al his earthly commodities and comforts, yet he ceaſeth not to be a ſuiter to the Lord for a new ſupply, nothing doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (notwithſtanding his former loſſes) but that in his goodneſſe he will releeue him: Which albeit he doe not for the preſent, accordingly as he hoped, yet deſiſteth he not to reſt vpon him, yea ſo farre is he from being deterred from ſeeking vnto him, (becauſe hee ſpeedeth not at the firſt) that he be commeth more earneſt in his ſupply cation, more humbly minded, more grieued for his ſins (concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the want of theſe, to haue withheld the Lords fauour from him) that hee armeth himſelfe with patience to take many denials, to waite the Lordes leaſure, how long ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, knowing that at the laſt, his deſire ſhall be granted.</p>
                  <p>And when the Lord layeth his chaſtizements vpon him the more grieuous they are, the more is he preſſed downe with the burden of them, the more is his hart lifted vppe, the more feruent is hee in ſpirit vnto the Lord for deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: or if that may not be graunted; for ſome eaſe of his paine, or elſe, if he will not bee intreated to withdraw his hand, ſtrength to beare them ſo, as he murmure not againſt him, but may be able willingly and cheerefully to ſuſtaine them ioyfully, and thankefully to vndergoe them: for hee conſidereth that the Lord doth this not to deſtroy him, but to ſaue him; not that hee ſhould periſh therein, but that being tryed, he ſhould be made more perfect; ſhould haue experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce how the Lord reſpecteth ſuch as beleeue in him, and can by no aduerſity be drawen away, from a loue and delight<note n="*" place="margin">In a cleane contrary courſe to the Hypocrite.

                  <p>Theſe things being wel layed together and examined to to the proofe, there will be no pretence left you, why you ſhould account me in the number of the Hyppocrites, and vngodly, becauſe that I euermore, euen in any moſt bitter

                  <p>WHerevnto I reply, that the wiſeſt and moſt learned,<note place="margin">Chap. 30 ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from ver. 1. et ſequent: appertaining to that matter.</note> the greateſt, graueſt, &amp; moſt auncient men that euer were haue had their errors: and this error is as old as any, to eſteeme of Gods fauour or diſpleaſure, according as hee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſeth of vs for theſe outward matters. For thus we reaſon, affliction came in through ſinne, and had not this been, wee ſhould haue liued ſtill in Paradiſe, a place abounding with all manner of pleaſure and delight, and into the which, no trouble or ſorrow might enter. I acknowledge it ſo to be, &amp; yet I ſay, that God for all that, is at liberty to afflict in other
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14506:78"/>reſpects, as well as for ſinne, which alſo he doth oftentimes. There were many hote<note n="* a" place="margin">Debate, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.

We may ſee therfore how dangerous a thing it is, to be too forward in wordes, before wee be ſure that we ſtand vppon a ſound foundation. For it will bring vs at the laſt to oppoſe our ſelues maliciouſly againſt the truth, to ſlaunder our brethren moſt groſly euen in thoſe things, wherein our owne knowledge, and experience bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diligently examined, pleadeth for them, and ſo hath <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphaz</hi> dealt by me.</p>
                  <p>Anger that predominate affection in old age, hath made him forget himſelfe; in which caſe, the wordes of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeſt, &amp; oldeſt man in the world muſt not be regarded. In that I am in contempt, and deriſion among the outcaſts, the froth and filth of the earth, this portion is common with me to all good men, this is alwaies a note of a godly man, a ſeale &amp; aſſurance the better to confirme vnto mee the right and intereſt that I haue through faith in my Redeemer, in the kingdome of God. For ſo it was with Noah that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Father.</p>
                  <p>Hee ſtanding out againſt all the Worlde in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce of this truth, that vnleſſe they repented, the Lord would bring the flood of waters, and vtterly conſume them all: what did they elſe but deride him, &amp; thoſe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe moſt of all that were moſt notoriouſly wicked; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, the moſt vile and contemptible in the eye of the world, beeing incited the rather therevnto to pleaſe the great ones, who are wont to vſe ſuch as inſtruments to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute theyr malice. Neyther were the children in the ſtreets, whoſe manner is to followe the example of their Parents, exempted from a part in this offence. And in very deede ſo it is, that ſcorne &amp; contempt is euermore an vnſeperable companion of the truth: and that there was neuer any one that tooke in hand the defence therof, but he hath bin deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed more or leſſe of the world. Error hath many waies, &amp; ſo
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14506:79"/>many followers: the truth but one, and therefore but fewe in reſpect that imbrace it. The truth is hardly found, and as hardly kept when it is found: for he that will find it, it will coſt him much ſweat, and when he hath it, if hee be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding carefull, he ſhall looſe it before he be aware. This makes it dainty, becauſe Induſtry &amp; Care be rare qualities. Nature and Grace are oppoſites: in Nature there is blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ignorance, it is Grace that brings vs to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth. Howſoeuer, reaſon may ſeeme to be ſome helpe there-vnto, yet becauſe it is greatly defaced in regard of that it was in our firſt creation, it cannot apprehend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other that which is diuine. For reaſon can neither beget, nor foſter, nor continue in vs the truth, nor diſcerne it from falſe-hoode; but all theſe are the workes of Grace. Howbeit, the greateſt part of the world content themſelues with that which Nature affordeth, and goeth no further.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that they which attaine vnto the truth, are wondred at for theyr ſingularitie, which procureth them many followers, and ſuch as flocke after them: and withall, the hatred of moſt, eſpecially of the mightie, and renowned of all ſorts, the condemnation of all degrees, ſaue onely of a very ſmall remnant, and that becauſe they want the light of grace to reach vnto theyr doctrines. Euen ſo it falleth out in this diſputation, for that I defende ſuch doctrines as are not futable to the generall receiued opinions among men; and for that againe they are aboue the capacity of that, man in nature comprehendeth: the learned, ſpecially in the ſchoole of humanitie, or profeſſing Diuinitie without the gift of the ſpirit of Grace, reprehend them; and the vnlearned, carried away with a conceite of the deepe iudgement of thoſe their profound leaders, make but a ſcoffe both of me, and what I affirme.</p>
                  <p>Heerevpon alſo commeth the vnreuerent behauiour of the children toward me: herevpon likewiſe it is, that no man pittieth my miſery, but when they ſee me grow weaker eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie day then other, my garments more defiled through the noyſomnes of my diſeaſe, my conſcience more affrighted

Which becauſe I knowe from what roote it ſpringeth, and withall, that I am not the firſt which haue ſuſtained ſuch croſſes, I ſatisfie my ſelfe with this, that I haue a cleere conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and deſire no fauour at his handes, if I haue not walked with an vpright hart in regard of his maieſtie. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I doubt, but aſſure my ſelfe, that if I holde out, (as I hope to doe, through the ſtrength of the ſame his grace which hath hethervnto ſupported mee) in the feare of his Name, and confidence of his mercy, conſtantly and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly in this my fiery triall: this my rebuke, reproch and iniury which I now ſuffer, ſhall be recompenced mee at the length, with praiſe, honour, reward and victory, to the great and endleſſe ioy of my ſoule.</p>
                  <p>It is very long before the Lord heareth my complaint, my ſicknes hath beene very tedious, and voyd of all outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and I am nowe brought to the laſt caſt, which maketh mee vtterly out of hope of the continuance of my life any longer: yet for all that I doube not of the Lordes power therein, and I knowe that his manner hath beene from time to time, then to ſhew himſelfe moſt ſtrong vnto them that depend vppon him, when themſelues are moſt weake, then to ſuccour his, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are euen ſinking downe vnder the burden; then to open vnto them a way to eſcape, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſee death and the graue preſent before theyr eyes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to ſwallow them vp.

And for mine owne behalfe, I make no doubt, though you, nor no man elſe beſide as of himſelfe, or by his owne wiſedome or profunditie is able, yet the Lord is able to bring him euen by me, a weaker meanes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your ſelues, to a ſight of his folly which hee hath committed in this diſputation, and a more reuerent regard of his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie.</p>

Attend now while I further ſhew you wherein you haue failed. Among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which you haue lay de vnto his charge, this hath not been the leaſt (as before I vrged) that he is a peruerſe &amp; obſtinate offender, ſuch a one, as by no meanes can bee brought to acknowledge his fault, when you your ſelues are culpable of this crime, and not hee. For obſtinacie is not to ſtand ſtifly in the defence of the truth, as <hi>Iob</hi> hath done: but in an errour, which is your caſe.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, where hee is innocent, there you labour to finde a hole in his coate: but where hee is guiltie, and to be
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:14506:82"/>blamed, there you preſſe not home enough to his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

                  <p>The latter of theſe two, argueth a want of that iudgment, vnderſtanding, and wiſedome, together with that temper in your affections as had beene requiſite, for otherwiſe (but that ye were blinded thereby) you would not haue ouerſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſuch manifeſt faultes: the former, a want of loue and equitie.

                  <p>That long<note n="e" place="margin">Chap. 34. from verſe 13 to 31.</note> oration therefore of thine, concerning the righteouſnes of GOD, though it be a worthy one, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth to confute any thing that I haue ſpoken, (for I haue<note n="f" place="margin">Chap. 12.</note> commended it as much my ſelfe) I will not denie, but that I ſaid the Lord hath remoued away my<note n="g" place="margin">Chap. 27. verſe 2.</note> iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but I vtterly denie thy interpretation thereof. For I had no thought therein to diſparage the Lordes vpright dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes mee, according to thy illation; but I conceiued it in this ſence, that my iudgement in the ſight of men, was ſuch as belonged to a moſt wicked perſon, and that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed vnto me, was not to be made a terror vnto others, in my rare and fearefull puniſhment, becauſe of my extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie wicked life, but to haue my reward; and this is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the eyes of men with the faithfull, whom the Lord in his mercy is wont to exempt from the horrible venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which he hath prepared for the vngodly.</p>
                  <p>I know well, that the righteous cannot be diſcerned from the vnrighteous by theſe outward afflictions, for that they are common as well to the one as to the other. And yet I know againe that the world is of another opinion, thinking them only in Gods fauour, that liue heere in a happy eſtate, which cauſed me to vtter forth theſe words, The Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth the<note n="h" place="margin">Chap, 9, verſe, 22</note> iuſt and vniuſt: that is to ſay, freeth neither of theſe from temporall calamitie: but this is farre from that thou gathereſt<note n="i" place="margin">Chap, 12, verſe 27,</note> therevpon, namely, that to ſtudie to pleaſe God, hath no profit in it.

For thou dooſt ſo take mee vp for this ſpeech, with ſome other of the like nature, as if I had therevy ſought to preferre my ſelfe before<note n="m" place="margin">verſe 12,</note> God; or inflamed with the ſpirit of arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, I had<note n="n" place="margin">Chap. 33 verſe 13</note> lifted vp mine arme againſt him.

Onely this is the difference betweene thee and my other Accuſers, they condemne me for my life paſt, thou for my preſent carriage in this cauſe. And thus I am prouoked and grieued euen by thy moderating of the controuerſie, becauſe partly thou dooſt not ſee ſo fully into the matter thou vndertakeſt, as were to be wiſhed; partlie, becauſe either thou dooſt not vnderſtand my meaning in many things, or elſe (which is worſe) thou dooſt wreſt the ſence of my words, &amp; dooſt carry them to another end then they were produced by me: partly alſo, becauſe the feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of thy zeale hath made thee to tranſgreſſe the boundes of modeſtie, and moderation in thy reproofes.</p>
                  <p>For hee that will doe good by his reprehenſion, muſt not onely looke to his groundes that they be ſound, and ſuch as cannot be confuted, but hee muſt haue alſo a regard of the manner of his proceeding therein, that it bee not in too much lenitie, nor in too much acerbitie, but ſutable euerie

                  <p>The propoſitions are the ſame as before, firſt, that the Lord hath a care of his ſeruants, &amp; defendeth them from the iniury of the<note n="f" place="margin">verſe 6.</note> Oppreſſour. For he is of ſo good a nature, &amp; ſo full of compaſſion, that hee cannot ſee his ſuffer the leaſt wrong but he muſt ſuccour them: and though the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour be ſtrong, hee feareth not to encounter with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his<note n="g" place="margin">

And no maruell, for beeing iuſt how can hee winke at the violence of the wicked,<note place="margin">Verſe, 15</note> or paſſe ouer the * wrongs of the afflicted?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, though it goe otherwiſe with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a while, yet hee lifteth them to<note n="h" place="margin">verſe 7</note> honour at the laſt, and bleſſeth them in the end. Thirdly, if they haue gone aſtray, reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them not, but reduceth and<note n="i" place="margin">ver 9, 10, 15,</note> bringeth them home againe by his louing<note n="k" place="margin">verſe 8,</note> chaſtiſements, &amp; after their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, comforteth theyr harts with the<note n="l" place="margin">verſe 11</note> ſweetnes of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer earthly delights, with a reſeruation alſo of more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent

Fourthly, and for the<note n="m" place="margin">verſe 12</note> other ſort that will not returne vnto him vppon his corrections, this is my rule, that the Lorde will purſue them with the ſworde, and other meſſengers of his wrath, neither will euer leane them, vntill he hath brought them vnto finall ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction for their obſtinacie.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, much after the ſame is my obſeruation for the cloſe and cunning hypocrite, who can ſo finely diſſemble the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneneſſe of his<note n="n" place="margin">verſe 13</note> hart, euen then couering his fault when the Lord correcteth him for it: neither will hee be induced to confeſſe it, howe heauie ſoeuer the hand of the Lord lie vppon him, but ſtill (though this be a meanes to heape the Lordes plagues more grieuouſly vppon his head) ſeeke to purge himſelfe, and lay the fault vpon God. Such a one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer cryes for mercie, neuer magnifieth the Lords goodnes, but is euer telling him of his owne deſerts, and of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his merrits.</p>

                  <p>The<note n="b" place="margin">Verſe 2</note> cauſe that moueth me vnto it, is partly the vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed ſpeeches voyde of vnderſtanding and iudgement, which haue eftſoomes ſlipped from thee, and among many others worthy of reprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thoſe which thou haſt ſpent about inquiring into the reaſon of thy viſitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which thou oughteſt not to haue done. Specially both to demaund the queſtion, and reſolue the doubt, and to determine in ſuch manner, as that it is not for thy ſins, making thereby thy ſelfe no ſinner, putting thy auditory in doubt, whether ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall corruption, were a ſin deſeruing puniſhment: and not contenting thy ſelfe with thy affliction vntill I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed it vnto thee. As being ignorant that my iudgments how ſecret ſoeuer they are, yet are they alwaies iuſt.</p>
                  <p>And partly, becauſe throgh thy ſo immoderate complaints and ſo without al meaſure of thy calamity, thou haſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the hearers, and made them to thinke that the Lorde (in thine opinion) did put no difference between the good and bad, but did handle them both alike, ayming at one and the ſelfe ſame end in each of them. And partly for thy ſo eager defending of thy innocency, and that without all meaſure, as hauing neuer done with it, neuer ſpoken en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough of it, together with an vtter forgetfulneſſe of my righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: Where by thou haſt giuen an occaſion to al that heard thee, to conclude from thine owne mouth, that thou holdeſt thy ſelfe more righteous then I: confirming them likewiſe in this their opinion, by challenging me often ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry boldly, without all reuerence and dread of my maieſty, to giue thee a day of hearing.</p>
                  <p>Thus haſt thou by thy vnskilfull, and vndiſcreere carry-age of thy cauſe, both obſcured thy ſelfe, defaced thy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and alſo impeached my iuſtice, weakened my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, darkened the brightneſſe of my glory and renowne. And thus farre haue I ſuffered thee, anſwering nothing in

Now then giue me<note n="c" place="margin">Verſe 3</note> leaue a little to reply vnto thee, and prouide thou thy ſelfe by all meanes, gather thy ſtrength together, ſtirre vp thy wittes, take courage vnto thee, and anſwer me.

For the earth being the foundation<note n="f" place="margin">Verſe 6</note> of the Worlde, and that vppon which the heauenly ſpheares are turned about; the other three elements of water, ayre, and fire, doe leaue, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it ſelfe of that exceeding great waight: muſt it not of neceſſity be both well vnderdroped, and firmely compac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together?</p>

So likewiſe, doth not that innumerable hoſt of Aungels, the Nobleſt of all my creatures, and neareſt vnto me and in that reſpect my Sons, extoll me for my vnſearchable wiſedome therein? And thus they did forthwith after I had framed the Heauen and the earth, applauding my skill, and greeting me with praiſe.</p>
                  <p>So did the heauenly bodies in like manner, lighting vp their Torches all at once, ſtanding euery one in his due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, flaming forth diuerſely in an equall and diſtinct ſort the one from the other, make a ſweete harmony and ſong

                  <p>But though the diuine ſpirits and celeſtiall company of heauenly Souldiers, did vppon the ſight of that exquiſite worke of ſixe daies, ſound forth with ioy and gladneſſe Hymnes of holineſſe, reuerence, and honor vnto my name: yet far was it from them to take vpon them ſuch ſtate as thou doſt, namely to ſeem companions and equals with me in the worke, or to intrude themſelues into the poſſeſſion of my prerogatiue, titles of Creator, Gouernor, &amp; Diſpoſer of the world.</p>

When he entreth to drinke in any of the greateſt vvaters, as Iordan, Euphrates, Tigris, or the like, he ſwalloweth vp the whole Riuer, and maketh it lowe for the time in that place. Hee ſtoppeth the courſe of the ſtreame where hee wadeth, and maketh it to ſtand on an heape and ouer-flovve the bankes. His trunke he letteth downe to a marueilous length when he goeth to drinke, his teeth are ſo long that they bore through vnto the bottom of the waters: his ſinnewes behind are like vnto the goodly boughes of the Cedar twined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

No bridle can be fitted for his head, becauſe his cheekes are as broade as the great portall of a Pallace, and of that thicknes and length, that though it were double, and double againe, yea tenfold, yet would it not ſerue the turne. But might there bee one framed for him, how ſhould it be gotten into his mouth, he beeing both as vntameable and as forceable alſo, as the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Sea wherein hee abideth?

Heerein hee vaunteth, and beareth himſelfe ſo bolde, that hee is at defiance with all the vvorld. When he ſwimmes againſt the winde and ſtreame, &amp; driues the ſwelling waues of the ſea before him with his<note n="d" place="margin">verſe 9, 10 11, 12.</note> neezing, ſuch flaſhes of fire appeare, as when the Smith faſhioneth his great Iron worke vpon his ſlithy. He ariſing out of the deepe, thou wouldeſt deeme the Sunne to ariſe out of the Sea, or lightning to proceede from the Eaſt, for his eyes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the beames of the morning, his mouth a fornace, his noſtrells a Diars Fat. At his breath the whole Sea ſeemeth to be ſet on fire. By reaſon of the brightnes of theſe ſeuerall parts, thou wouldeſt imagine heere a Torch to be kindled, there ſparkles of fire to iſſue foorth, heere ſtubble to burne into a great flame, there a thicke ſmoake like vnto a clowde

For thou vndertookeſt that he ſhould be at vtter defiance with me, forſake quite his confidence in mee, fall finally from mine obedience, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wholy and perpetually thine without recouery. Thou makeſt light account of the knowledge of the hart, vvhen that is all in all, neither can there any right iudgement bee giuen of the actions of man, without the true knowledge thereof. And this may yeelde great comfort vnto man, that howſoeuer thou accuſeſt him before mee, whatſoeuer grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous matter thou layeſt to his charge, yet thou dooſt all vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon bare coniecture, not knowing indeede how it ſtandeth with him, as beeing altogether ignorant what is the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his hart, and if that be faithfull, not to regard thy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections.</p>
                  <p>But what blaſphemie is that thou vomiteſt foorth by way of Parentheſis, who knoweth Iobs hart to be vpright beſide my ſelfe? How now Sathan, wilt thou diſanull my authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? Shall not my Word, which alone gaue beeing to all Creatures, without any other witneſſes, be a ſufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it ſelfe?

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:14506:122"/>fallen from mee, and to recouer him home againe vnto me. But yet though it be with much labour and paines, I bring it to paſſe notwithſtanding at the laſt. But as for thee &amp; thy retinue, that fell from me before him, there was no meanes to reclaime you, no way to reuerſe you, but albeit I<note n="1" place="margin">Humanitus dictum.</note> ſtriued, and ſtudied what I could for your alteration, nothing would worke vpon you, your miſchieuous diſpoſition would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no reſtraint, but flinging from my preſence, yee would throw your ſelues head-long into that reſt-leſſe bed of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe miſery.</p>
                  <p>Is not Iob therefore, together with euery true beleeuer, notwithſtanding all theſe frailties, worthily preferred before thee, and art not thou woorthily condemned? doe they not iuſtly triumph ouer thee, &amp; trample thee vnder their feete? And ſeeing my honour is in vanquiſhing ſuch an enemie, that is ſo maliciouſly bent againſt mee, why ſhould I not ſet vp my Trophies as a ſigne of victory ouer him? The elder men are, the more wily and wary be they, thou haſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this in thy ſelfe, and therefore thou ſhalt more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take them with thy baites then before. Haddeſt thou any aduantage by the long liues of the Fathers that liued before the flood? Did not thoſe that were godly among them, through theyr many yeeres, gather vnto themſelues more wiſedome and ſtrength to ouer come thy tentations? Thou haſt ſmall cauſe to preſume, and leſſe to vaunt (and had deſt thou not more then a fore-head of braſſe, thou wouldeſt not now doe it) of hope of victory in time to come, through the increaſe of wealth, yea of doubling &amp; tripling the ſame vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him tenne-folde, this thou ſpeakeſt by way of ſcorne, (I would indeed the world regarded riches no more then thou dooſt, but onely that thou maieſt vſe them as a Fouler doth his Nette, to inſnare the ſoules of men, and thou the honor of my Name more then thou art wont) ſeeing that before thou did deſt complaine of that, as the onely barre againſt thee.</p>
                  <p>Vſe what meanes thou wilt, doe thou and thy complices what you can, (yea let all the creatures vnder heauen ioyne

Thou confeſſeſt, that thou couldeſt not haue ſo much as mooued thy ſinger againſt Iob, without my ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Commiſſion, were there not therefore great weakenes in him, or any other, (for my protection reacheth vnto all my Choſen in like manner) to eſteeme of thy threatning? But in this thy threatning, thy extreame malice againſt mee and mine, bewrayeth it ſelfe what it is, which maladie of thine, foſter and nouriſh it within thee as much as thou wilt, it ſhall but breede thine owne woe, it ſhall not any way touch mee, or any of mine Elect, any further then it may ſerue for their benefit; not any way turne to my diſhonour, but make for my greater honour &amp; renowne, as doth moſt liuely appeare by this preſent action againſt Iob.</p>
                  <p>For what greater glory couldeſt thou poſsiblie haue brought vnto my Name, then thou haſt done hereby? For heerein how ridiculous (for moſt odious haſt thou beene in the eyes of all men from the beginning) thou haſt ſhevved thy ſelfe, I ſhall not neede any longer to diſpute, ſeeing the euent it ſelfe, now ſhining foorth to the view of Men and Angels, is and will euer be, euen vnto the worlds end, when ſoeuer thou ſhalt make the like attempt, as an Herauld pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming in thy eares, Iob gaue Sathan a notable repulſe.
